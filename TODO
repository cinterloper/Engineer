Brainstorm on broadphase:

Begin with the leaf node that the ray originates in, in the octree.


First, traverse up to the parent. For each branch off the parent (sibling), test if that branch
   has any other children.

For each child, traverse downwards, detecting at each level if any children intersect with the ray.

Second, see if those children intersect with our ray. Keep a list of those that do.

Finally, if any of those children are octree nodes containing objects, enqueue an intersection test (ray vs AABB)
   with each.

If the first step evaluated to true, for each successful intersection, perform the last 4 steps
   using the next parent up as the new target.


Things to do:

Set up user input system.
Write basic raytracer on cpu.
