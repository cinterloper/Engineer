<brokenshakles> god why doesnt the Eo have a parent pointer passed with it by default?
<raster> ?
<raster> efl_parent_get() happily gets the parent obj?
<brokenshakles> oh?
<brokenshakles> is there an efl_pd_get() as well to get the pd from that?
<raster> efl_scope_data_get() ?
<raster> from the parent obj?
<raster> give it the class u want?
<brokenshakles> Ah.
